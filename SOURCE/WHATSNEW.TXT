  10% the Player32.DLL will take all time it can get to
  fill the Buffer to more than 50% and then it will return

  cards. To use it you have to set the envirorment variable
  (Control Panel->System->Envirorment) "SAM9407=330" where 
  330 is the base port in hex...and you have to boot DOS 
  before Windows NT to upload the firmware!

  TerraTec's EWS64 XL)

1997/1/31

  + Set the UltraSnd=2x0,xx,xx,xx,xx envirorment!
  - The GUS mixer must be set up in DOS/Win95 before
  - GUS Timing not very good yet
* Probably more stable VxD-Timer in Windows 3.1/95
  (On system hang up Problems just delete TrlPlay.*
   and report this to me)

* Player32.dll crashed if the selected wave driver was already open
* Fast Forward and Rewind didn't work if the FX Panel was closed
* GUSPnP public beta 3 drivers v2.0 do not work in software mixing 
  mode. THIS IS NOT A MOD4WIN BUG! Start MPlayer with a big WAV file 
  and make the sound drop (Start a time consuming 16Bit app)...the 
  time wil count on but the sound will mute...

!! UNDOCUMENTED MOD4WIN !!
--------------------------

We had no time to write a new old setup.
So here're some new options for you:

Add this section to your WIN.INI

Here's the default settings if no [Player32] Section is in your WIN.INI:
[Player32]
UseHardware=1     ;1=Autodetect GUS etc.; 0=No Detection==>No Hardware Mixing!
PALTiming=0       ;NTSC/PAL-Timing (Switch, if some samlpes have pauses or do
                  ;not play till their end during playback)
PeakSearch=1      ;1=enable peak search before playback starts
ShowPeakSearch=0  ;1=show peak search progress bar
ExactPeakSearch=1 ;1=Do iterative peak Search...avoids OverAmping but is slower
PeakHold=0        ;1=Do not Decrease CPU Load (useful for Speed Tests)
LoadProgress=0    ;1=show progress indicator while samples are being loaded to
                  ;GUS/OPL4/EWS64 RAM
